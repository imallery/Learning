This folder contains a pet file that I made while learning html forms, it includes example usage of:
1) text inputs
2) number inputs
3) radio buttons
4) dropdown lists
5) data lists
6) text area inputs

This is accompanied by the css file that gives the page it's style, I did not create that part unfortunately

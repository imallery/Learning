<h1>Form Practice</h1>

This folder contains a pet file that I made while learning html forms, it includes example usage of:
<ul>
  <li>text inputs</li>
  <li>number inputs</li>
  <li>radio buttons</li>
  <li>dropdown lists</li>
  <li>data lists</li>
  <li>text area inputs</li>
</ul>

This is accompanied by the css file that gives the page it's style, I did not create that part unfortunately
